## Project Description
This project aims to develop a system for detecting malware using image recognition techniques. The system uses deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, and different optimization algorithms like Adam, Adadelta, and Adamax to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between malware and benign files.

The system is trained on a dataset of images that contains both malware and benign files, where each image is a representation of the binary code of the file. The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into a suitable format for training the models.

The models are evaluated on various metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, time delay, and standard deviation. The precision measures the percentage of malware predictions that are correct, while the recall measures the percentage of malware instances that are correctly predicted. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. The time delay measures the time taken by each model to make predictions, and the standard deviation measures the variance in the prediction accuracy of each model.

The results of the evaluation show that the deep learning models can achieve high accuracy in detecting malware, with F1 scores ranging from 0.845 to 0.897. Moreover, the models can make predictions with a low time delay, indicating their practical use in real-time applications.

Overall, this project provides a valuable contribution to the field of malware detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of image recognition techniques in detecting malware and highlighting the importance of using deep learning models in building robust malware detection systems.
